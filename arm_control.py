"""xArm control for the Selfie Station.

Importing this module loads the xArm SDK but does NOT connect to the robot —
the connection is opened lazily on the first move call (get_arm), so the
FastAPI app still starts if the arm is offline.

Motion model:
- The "are we there yet?" check (`arm_at_pose`) is a *pure read* of the live
  joint angles via api_get_servo_angle. It never commands motion.
- Trajectory following (`arm_follow`) issues one blocking api_set_servo_angle
  per waypoint, so every intermediate pose is honored — it is never a single
  direct move to the goal pose.
- Homing is gated (`_arm_deployed`): `move_arm_home` only commands motion if
  `move_arm_to_selfie` armed the gate this session. A stray or automatic
  /disconnect on an arm that was never deployed is a no-op, so the arm is
  never driven into motion uncommanded.
